        h2 Powerful Innovation
        ul 
          li Next-Gen Liquid Nitrogen Tech
          ul 
            li Cryometrix products don't use traditional mechanical compressors that utilize refrigerants, an example being freon, to produce cold temperatures. These are noisy and use large amounts of electricity.
            li LN2 has a boiling point of -196&degC, enabling temperatures as low as -196&degC. Most refrigerants have boiling points greater than -100&degC, making it difficult for technology that uses them to generate temperatures below that.
          li Low Energy Usage
          ul 
            li Cryometrix tech use 7x less electricity than comparable products.
            li LN2 operates on pressure and requires no electricity to function, enabling it to function without power in emergency situations.
          li Extreme Reliability
          ul 
            li Cryometrix freezing technology doesn't require HVAC systems to cool the ambient temperature in order to operate. It can operate in any ambiance and cools the environment around it.
            li There are practically no moving parts in Cryometrix LN2 freezing technology, making it last up to 4 times as long as comparable freezing technology, in addition to requiring hardly any maintenance.
            li Practically silent when in operation.
          li Easily Expandable
          ul 
            li Cryometrix products consume little electricity, enabling the customer to add additional units to their facility with zero electrical complications.
            li The effective footprint is 16 square feet and little to no space is needed on the sides, easily fitting into any facility.
          li Extreme Versatility
          ul 
            li The L-80 can chill any liquid that can handle the ultra-low temperatures at which it operates.
      div
        h2 Environment Friendly
        ul
          li Clean Emissions
          ul 
            li Cryometrix products only emit nitrogen outside your building, which already makes up over 75% of the Earth's atmosphere.

      div
        h2 Cost Efficiency
        ul
          li Space Efficient
          ul 
            li The Cryometrix L-80 Solvent Chiller has the smallest footprint for its liquid chilling capability, costing less in floor space and allowing you to fit more units in your current space.
          li Simple Design
          ul 
            li The simple functioning and operation of the L-80 doesn't require extensive training, reducing labor costs and risks.
          li Low Energy Costs
          ul 
            li LN2 technology uses much less electricity than traditional compressor-based technologies.
            li Cryometrix products don't need energy intensive HVAC systems to operate efficiently.
          li Greater Throughput
          ul 
            li The increased capability of the L-80 allows faster turnaround times and thus greater profits.
      div
        h2 Complete Safety
        ul
          li Closed Nitrogen System
          ul 
            li There is zero contact between LN2 and the operator or product.
            li LN2 storage is simple and completely autonomous.
          li Unreactive
          ul 
            li Nitrogen isn't flammable or explosive like many refrigerants used in compressor-based technologies.
          li Easy Cleaning
          ul 
            li The 100% stainless steel design is easy to clean without harsh industrial chemicals.
      div
        h2 Sample Integrity
        ul
          li Closed System
          ul 
            li No LN2 is exposed to the sample, maintaining the samples integrity.
          li Data-Logging
          ul 
            li The L-80 automatically tracks temperature and other useful data.
          li Temperature Uniformity
          ul 
            li A cryogenic pump maintains high flux throughout chilled liquid, maintaining even temperatures throughout.
